# js-sorting

A collection of sorting algorithms written in JavaScript. Each algorithm is enclosed in its own file wrapped in a [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][1] API to make it easier to use across multiple platforms.

To learn more about how each algorithm is implemented have a look at the [technical articles on my blog][2].

## Testing

    npm init
    jasmine-node .
